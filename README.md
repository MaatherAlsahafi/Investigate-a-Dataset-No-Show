# Investigate-a-Dataset-No-Show
For this project I investigated the No-show appointment dataset which was my choice among others datasets provided by Udacity. This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil, focusing on the question of whether or not patients show up to their appointment.We have to mention that the dataset originated fromÂ Kaggle
